This is a DSL for Amazon CloudFormation

See tests and example-node.py for usage

TODO
----

 * provide a way to set defaults for resources
 * provide an example of Stack inheritance
 * use cfn-validate-template
 * parameters, mappings, outputs
  * or maybe use argparse in an example to cirumvent parameters
 * Write or generate classes for all cfn template types
  * maybe we could write a json schema for it?..

Caveats
-------

It only contains a very small part of CloudFormation types
